# Flex Panels Gallery

### #JavaScript30

This is the fifth of the 30 day Vanilla [JS Challenge](http://https://javascript30.com/ "JS Challenge") by Wes Bos.  The focus of the challenge was implementing flex characteristics on a gallery of photos (in panel format). In addition to adding the flex properties to the panels in CSS, event listeners were added to the JS code to add the appropriate toggle open and active classes (which cue transitions) when the panels are clicked on.

The **technologies** used were:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

Initially, this is how it looks like:

Once you click on the panel, here is what happens:
